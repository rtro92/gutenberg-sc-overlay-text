For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== What image dimensions should I use? ==

The recommended image dimensions are 1200x500, however any image will work. The image is stretched using cover and centered,
so take that into consideration when selecting an image.

== Is the background color customizable? ==

This feature will be added in future updates. However no the default color is rgba(0,0,0, 0.5) with a font color of #FFF.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
